# URL Shortener

This project was created as a recruitment task for the company **Szko≈Ça w Chmurze**. This project provides a simple REST API for generating short links for given URLs. The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework, using SQLite as the database.

I decided that the visual layer is not necessary. 
- I could do it like in classic Django using templates 
- or using frontend frameworks. 

I decided that in this case, such functionality is enough.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Django 5.2.3
- djangorestframework 3.16.0

All dependencies are listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).


## Usage
To start the Django development server:
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
